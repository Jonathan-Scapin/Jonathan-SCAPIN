### Hello World 👋

I'm a web developer based in France, specializing in building performant, maintainable, and responsible WordPress websites.

- 🔧 I mainly work with **PHP** on custom **WordPress** projects.
- 🎯 I use **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)** daily to build clean and flexible admin interfaces.
- 🌱 I'm currently developing a **custom WordPress theme** based on ACF components, following **eco-conception best practices**.
- 🖥️ I'm leveling up my skills in **Linux** and **server infrastructure**, deploying sites on **custom VPS** for better control and security.
- 💬 Always happy to discuss performance, accessibility, and sustainable web design.
